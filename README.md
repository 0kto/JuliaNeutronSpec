## Introduction
This package aims to provide a lightweight and modular approach to data analysis for Inelastic Neutron Scattering experiments.
It contains routines to read various file formats for different Triple Axis Spectrometers and extends popular Julia packages to provide a flexible workflow for data analysis.
It can easily be extended, making it possible to create custom workflows that provide analysis steps even for complex experiments.

## Current status
This package is the result of my PhD and Post-Doc in Neutron Scattering Experiments.
Since I have since left the field, I will polish and publish the existing code base, and make it available via GitHub.

## Installation and Usage
Since the package is not yet listed in the official Julia Repository of Packages, the Git project needs to be cloned.
It can be used from the julia console, but it is recommended to use in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Examples
Examples of use will be provided soon.

## Feedback wanted
If you would like to provide feedback or contributions, feel free to open issues or create pull requests, help is appreciated :)
